            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>Despite my young age, I have experienced many different transitions, environments, and difficulties, which give me the versatility and resilience that set me apart from most other people. It started early on, when my parents pulled me out of school to homeschool me in kindergarten. As a result, I was able to grow up loving learning. A major foundation of my education was reading, and I learned to love the many different books I read. I was also able to learn at my own pace, which helped me take more time with difficult topics, but mostly to get ahead and learn at an advanced level. This experience set me up to be able to learn at my own pace and have a genuine excitement towards learning new topics and skills.</p>
            <p>After being homeschooled for six years, my family went through a major transition and moved overseas to Malaysia, where I attended a tiny international school for my seventh grade year. I had never experienced a change so dramatic, and I had to adjust to a new type of schooling, a new set of friends, and an entirely different culture. Then, after about a year, we were suddenly informed that we had to leave as a result of visa issues, so we packed up and were gone within a couple weeks. The transitioning didn't stop after that, however, as I attended a different school each year after moving back to the US up until I started college. This half decade of constant transition taught be to be resilient, flexible, and how to quickly establish quality relationships, all skills which have been very helpful throughout my life.</p>

            <h3>My Time at MSU</h3>
            <p>After finishing highschool, I was super excited to start college at MSU, a school I have major ties to and ended up being the only college I ever seriously considered. Despite the anticipation I had going in, my first year ended up being really hard for me. I had never been away from my family that consistently, and had trouble maintaining positive routines. I ended up struggling to even try in my classes, and my mental health took a turn for the worst. Then the shooting happened. The months following were the worst of my life, as I fell deeper into a mental rut. However, this experience ended up being positive, as the following school year, I became super passionate about helping out other students who were struggling and lost like I was. With some friends (pictured below), I co-founded START (Students Teaming for Advocacy and Recovery Together), which aimed to help students struggling with unhealthy substance use find the resources and community they need to regain control of their life. </p>

            <h3>START Successes</h3>
            <p>Throughout my time at START, our main goal was to figure out exactly how we could make a real impact on the student body to help struggling students. We knew there was a major need for a reframing of the issue of substance abuse on campus, and we also knew that there were already great resources in place to help students, but many weren't aware of them or didn't feel comfortable taking advantage of them. Based on this, we decided that START's main initiative would be to host events that both create a comfortable and enjoyable space for students and also provide them with the opportunity to have open dialogue about topic of substance use and interact with the available resources. After taking our first year to figure out this direction, we had a very successful second year, hosting two events like this, the Fall Sunset Picnic and the Habits Masterclass, both which exceeded our attendance and engagement expectations. The Habits Masterclass was especially exciting for us, because at the end, many of the attendance chose to speak up and openly discuss their personal experiences with substance use. This was a real proof of concept for us, and a sign that START could have a huge impact on the MSU student body. I am super excited to keep up with START and see what they are able to accomplish in the coming years.</p>

                <h3>Design Experience</h3>
                <p id="design-text">I have been blessed to engage with some really exciting projects during my time as an information science student at MSU. In one of my classes, I had the opportunity to design a technology to help elderly populations in Kenya learn digital literacy concepts. As someone who is very interested in Africa, I loved being able to take the time to dive deep into Kenyan culture and learn more about the issues Kenyans face. It was also a great opportunity to apply design principles to unique contexts. I was so excited about this project that me and a teammate even used the topic as our problem statement for the first ever MSU Designathon, where our project won the prizes for both sustainability and diversity in design.</p>
                <h3>What's Next</h3>
                <p>Now that I have graduated from MSU, I'll be spending the next year in a gap year program called the Fellows Initiative. This program is run through Storyhill Church in Davidson, North Carolina, and gives me the opportunity to get real work experience while taking the time to set myself up for a life filled with purpose and meaning moving forward.
